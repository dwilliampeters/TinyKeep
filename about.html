						<h1>A new way to dungeon crawl</h1>
					</header>

					<div class="entry">

						<p>TinyKeep is a 3D dungeon crawler with heavy focus on unique game mechanics and smart monster AI. The game is currently under active development. We expect to loosen its shackles and release it from our dungeons sometime at the end of 2014.</p>

						<p>In the meantime, here’s a brief list of our cunning plans:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>A mix of seeded procedurally generated random dungeons with authored content - no boring generic levels!</li>
							<li>Beautiful dynamically lit 3D graphics for a variety of environments - cold slimy walls, hot fiery pits and pitch black corridors.</li>
							<li>Persistent characters - collect legendary weapons, improve your character and tackle increasingly harder dungeons.</li>
							<li>The innovative Pocket Inventory system that combines stats, customization, inventory, equipment and skills into a single accessible game mechanic.</li>
							<li>A variety of intelligent monsters each with their own unique behaviours and traits. Creatures work together to chase you down and flee from threats.</li>
							<li>Beautiful hand painted 3D monsters from our talented artist Matthias Andre of BitGem.</li>
						</ul>

						<h1>History and lore</h1>
					</header>

					<div class="entry">

						<p>Many years ago, in an age lost in the mists of time, one programmer called Phi Dinh set to work on creating his dream game - a casual 2D multiplayer roguelike. A simple prototype was lovingly crafted, and he and his friends spent many sleepless nights exploring the depths of the procedurally generated chaos. Thus, TinyKeep was born.</p>

									</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>But it wasn’t enough.</p>

						<p>Phi felt the game needed something more. He wanted smarter monsters. Better graphics. He wanted a twist on the tired old RPG mechanics that plagued so many titles in the genre. He wanted something that felt fresh and accessible for new players, yet still challenging and full of depth for the old. Ben was recruited to help define the gameplay, and a talented artist was soon discovered. Within 2 months, a proof-of-concept was developed, and the team launched the project on <a href="#" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.</p>

								<a href="#" target="_blank"><img class="gallery-thumb" src="img/content/about.tiny-keep-4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>On May 31st 2013 at 5:33am, TinyKeep got successfully funded by 802 loyal dungeoneers. At long last, Phi can now finally achieve his vision and make TinyKeep into the game that it deserves to be!</p>
